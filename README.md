# Investigate-No-show-appointments-Dataset
UDACITY Data Analysis Nanodegree Project 02: investigating a dataset "no show appointments".
## Summary
This was the second project in Data Analyst Nanodegree from Udacity. In this project, I analyzed Medical Appointment No Shows Dataset and communicated my findings about it using Python libraries NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib, and seaborn. The dataset collects information from 110k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment.
